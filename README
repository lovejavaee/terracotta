Overview
--------

Distributed HA caching/storage platform for Java.

Terracotta provides out of the box clustering for a number of well known Java
frameworks, including EHCache, Hibernate and Quartz as well as clustering
for J2EE containers.

The Open Source version of Terracotta allows for one active server and multiple
hot standby servers.  Mirror groups, authentication and other features require
a paid license and are not currently supported by this charm.
 
Usage
-----

To deploy a Terracotta service:

  juju deploy --repository . local:terracotta terracotta

Add one or more hot standby units:

  juju add-unit terracotta

Units within a service will automatically configure themselves to have one
active server and one or more hot standby servers.

The Terracotta Developer Console can be used to view performance metrics
amongst other monitoring tools.  Download and extract the Terracotta Open Source
tarball (http://www.terracotta.org/downloads/open-source) and run
'bin/dev-console.sh'.  Specify one of your units as the host and port 9520.
For cloud based deployments, you can use a port forwarded ssh tunnel if you add
the internal IP of the unit as an alias for localhost in your '/etc/hosts' file.
